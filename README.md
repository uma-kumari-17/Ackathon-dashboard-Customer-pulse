## Features

 - **Task Board Layout and Drag-and-Drop** - Task Managment incorporates a responsive Task Board layout, categorizing tasks into columns such as **To Do, In Progress, Testing, and Done.** The intuitive drag-and-drop functionality allows users to effortlessly move tasks between these columns, reflecting real-time progress.

- **Task Cards** - Each task card displays key information, including task name, assignee, priority, start date, and effort spent. This approach ensures that users have all relevant details at their fingertips.

- **Task Metrics** - Task metrics, such as the total number of tasks, people involved, and cumulative effort spent, are dynamically calculated and presented on the dashboard, providing valuable insights into project progress.

- **Search Functionality** - Task Managment incorporates a robust search functionality that enables users to search for tasks by name across all task groups. This feature enhances efficiency in locating specific tasks within the project.

- **Filters** - Users can filter tasks based on Start/End dates, assignees, and severity. This flexibility allows teams to focus on specific subsets of tasks, improving task management and planning.

- **Colors/Badges for Task Severity** - To visually distinguish task severity, Task Managment assigns unique colors or badges to each severity level (High, Medium, Low). This visual cue aids quick identification and prioritization of tasks.

- **Light and Dark Mode** - Task Managment offers users the choice between light and dark modes to accommodate different preferences and reduce eye strain during prolonged usage.
